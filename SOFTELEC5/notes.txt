Fundamentals

What is mongoDB?
	Document oriented DB
	non-relational (no transactions)
	JSON Data type
	Horizontal Scaling 
		- upgrade hardware of server.
		- 2 or more servers.
		- very cheap
		- difficult to config.
		- need to identify the master from others.
		- if master is full adds a new server replicated from master
		- downside need to replicate schema
	* Vertical Scaling - to upgrade needs to restart. 1 server to upgrade.
	dynamic schema - flexible table columns

	typical json document
	
	db.collection.insert({
		"firstName": "Kyel",
		"lastName": "David",
		"nickName": "Pogi",
		"hobbies": [
			"programming",
			"dota"
		]
	});

	What about Objects?

	Collection:
		a collection has functions
		different fields

	Fields that I don't know

	"birthDate: new Date()

	Embedded Document
		can contain entire documents
