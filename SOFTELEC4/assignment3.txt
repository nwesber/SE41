What is a test plan?

A test plan is a document that describes a testing scope and the activities involve. It is the sole basis for formally testing any software or product. It identifies amongst other test items, the features that needed testing, the testing tasks and which software tester will do test. It is the record of the whole testing process. There are three types of test plans first is the master plan the single highest-level test plan for a project that unifies all other test plan. Second, is the testing level specific test plans which contains unit test plan, integration test plan, system test plan, and acceptance test plan and lastly the third type is the testing type specific test plans where the team plans for major types of testing like performance test plan and security test plan.

Test planning is one of the most important activity in an STLC to ensure that there is initially a list of tasks and milestones in a baseline plan to track the progress of the project. It also defines the size of the test effort. It is the main document often called as master test plan or a project test plan and usually developed during the early phase of the project. These documents serve as means of communication across the software team. They can also help track changes to the testing project overall. As changes to the test plan are made the test plan document should be updated to reflect those decisions.
